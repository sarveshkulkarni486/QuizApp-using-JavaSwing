# QuizApp-using-JavaSwing
Technology used:
1. Java
2. Javax Swing
3. Java AWT
4. JFree chart

JavaxSwing : it is used to create frame and all other component for view 
Java AWT: It is used because it contains event listener which is used to interact with user after clicking the button what event should happen this is possible by eventlistener interface.
JFree chart: It is a library/JAR file which was introduced by David Gilbert which has create some classes, interfaces, and predefined methods which we can use to create chart the chart can vary upon your choice which can be bar-chart, graph or pie chart
For showing result I have used pie-chart which probably is good to visual which has parameter like title, legend, tooltip legend help us to visualize the data in particular shape and tooltip help us to show the description of pie-chart after hovering it.
I have also used PiePlot class which is used to define the color of pie-chart probably used green color for correct answer and red color for wrong answer.
..update **note**: probably label isn't responsive one trying to make it more responsive and changing in font-size very soon and updated file would be uploaded on it very soon.
